= Install to CentOS 8 --- How to install milter manager to CentOS 8

== About this document

This document describes how to install milter manager to CentOS 8.
See ((<Install|install.rd>)) for general install
information.

In this document, CentOS 8.3 is used. Sudo is used to run a command
with root privilege. If you don't use sudo, use su instead.

== Install packages

Postfix is used as MTA because it's installed by default.

Spamass-milter, clamav-milter and milter-greylist are used as
milters. Milter packages registered in EPEL are used.

Register EPEL like the following:

  % sudo dnf install -y epel-release

Now, you install milters:

  % sudo dnf install -y spamass-milter-postfix clamav-scanner-systemd clamav-update clamav-milter clamav-milter-systemd milter-greylist

And you install RRDtool for generating graphs:

  % sudo dnf install -y rrdtool

== Build and Install

milter manager can be installed by dnf.

Register milter manager yum repository like the following:

  % curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/milter-manager/repos/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash

See also: ((<URL:https://packagecloud.io/milter-manager/repos/install>))

Enable (({ruby:3.0})) module:

  % sudo dnf module -y enable ruby:3.0

Now, you install milter manager:

  % sudo dnf install -y milter-manager

== Configuration

Here is a basic configuration policy.

milter-greylist should be applied only if
((<S25R|URL:http://gabacho.reto.jp/en/anti-spam/>))
condition is matched to reduce needless delivery delay.
But the configuration is automatically done by
milter manager. You need to do nothing for it.

It's difficult that milter manager runs on SELinux. Disable SELinux
policy module for Postfix and Milter.

  % sudo semodule -d postfix
  % sudo semodule -d milter

# TODO: When milter policy version upgrade to 1.3.1 or later, research
# about semanager and milter_port_t and update this section.
# semanage port -a -t milter_port_t -p tcp <port>

=== Configure spamass-milter

At first, you configure spamd.

spamd adds "[SPAM]" to spam mail's subject by default. If
you don't like the behavior, edit
/etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf.

Before:
  rewrite_header Subject [SPAM]

After:
  # rewrite_header Subject [SPAM]

Add the following configuration to
/etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf. This configuration is for adding
headers only if spam detected.

  remove_header ham Status
  remove_header ham Level

Start spamd on startup:

  % sudo systemctl enable spamassassin

Start spamd:

  % sudo systemctl start spamassassin

Here are spamass-milter's configuration items:

  * Disable needless body change feature.
  * Reject if score is larger than or equal to 15.

Change /etc/sysconfig/spamass-milter:

Before:
  #EXTRA_FLAGS="-m -r 15"

After:
  EXTRA_FLAGS="-m -r 15"

Start spamass-milter on startup:

  % sudo systemctl enable spamass-milter

Start spamass-milter:

  % sudo systemctl start spamass-milter

=== Configure clamav-milter

Update ClamAV virus database and start clamd.

Edit /etc/freshclam.conf like the following. It comments out
"Example", changes "NotifyClamd" value and uncomments other
items.

Before:
  Example
  #LogFacility LOG_MAIL
  #NotifyClamd /path/to/clamd.conf

After:
  #Example
  LogFacility LOG_MAIL
  NotifyClamd /etc/clamd.d/scan.conf

Run freshclam by hand at the first time:

  % sudo freshclam

Configure clamd.

Edit /etc/clamd.d/scan.conf like the following. It comments out
"Example" and uncomments other items:

Before:
  Example
  #LogFacility LOG_MAIL
  #LocalSocket /run/clamd.scan/clamd.sock

After:
  #Example
  LogFacility LOG_MAIL
  LocalSocket /run/clamd.scan/clamd.sock

Start clamd on startup:

  % sudo systemctl enable clamd@scan

Start clamd:

  % sudo systemctl start clamd@scan

Configure clamav-milter.

Edit /etc/mail/clamav-milter.conf like the following. It comments out
"Example", change "ClamdSocket" value and uncomments other items:

Before:
  Example
  #MilterSocket /run/clamav-milter/clamav-milter.socket
  #MilterSocketMode 660
  #ClamdSocket tcp:scanner.mydomain:7357
  #LogFacility LOG_MAIL

After:
  #Example
  MilterSocket /run/clamav-milter/clamav-milter.socket
  MilterSocketMode 660
  ClamdSocket unix:/run/clamd.scan/clamd.sock
  LogFacility LOG_MAIL

Add "clamilt" user to "clamscan" group to access clamd's socket:

  % sudo usermod -G clamscan -a clamilt

Start clamav-milter on startup:

  % sudo systemctl enable clamav-milter

Start clamav-milter:

  % sudo systemctl start clamav-milter

=== Configure milter-greylist

Change /etc/mail/greylist.conf for the following
configurations:

  * use the leading 24bits for IP address match to avoid
    Greylist adverse effect for sender uses some MTA case.
  * decrease retransmit check time to 10 minutes from 30
    minutes (default value) to avoid Greylist adverse effect.
  * increase auto whitelist period to a week from 1 day
    (default value) to avoid Greylist adverse effect.
  * don't use Greylist when trusted domain passes SPF.
    (Trusted domains are configured in milter manager)
  * use Greylist by default.

  # note
  The configuration relaxes Greylist check to avoid Greylist
  adverse effect. It increases received spam mails but you
  should give priority to avoid false positive rather than
  false negative. You should not consider that you blocks all
  spam mails by Greylist. You can blocks spam mails that
  isn't blocked by Greylist by other anti-spam technique
  such as SpamAssassin. milter manager helps constructing
  mail system that combines some anti-spam techniques.

Before:
  socket "/run/milter-greylist/milter-greylist.sock"
  # ...
  racl whitelist default

After:
  socket "/run/milter-greylist/milter-greylist.sock" 660
  # ...
  subnetmatch /24
  greylist 10m
  autowhite 1w
  sm_macro "trusted_domain" "{trusted_domain}" "yes"
  racl whitelist sm_macro "trusted_domain" spf pass
  racl greylist sm_macro "trusted_domain" not spf pass
  racl greylist default

Start milter-greylist on startup:

  % sudo systemctl enable milter-greylist

Start milter-greylist:

  % sudo systemctl start milter-greylist

=== Configure milter manager

Add "milter-manager" user to "clamilt" group to access
clamav-milter's socket:

  % sudo usermod -G clamilt -a milter-manager

Add "milter-manager" user to "mail" group and "grmilter" group to
access milter-greylist's socket:

  % sudo usermod -G mail -a milter-manager
  % sudo usermod -G grmilter -a milter-manager

Add "milter-manager" user to "postfix"" group to access
spamass-milter's socket:

  % sudo usermod -G postfix -a milter-manager

milter manager detects milters that installed in system.
You can confirm spamass-milter, clamav-milter and
milter-greylist are detected:

  % sudo /usr/sbin/milter-manager -u milter-manager -g milter-manager --show-config

The following output shows milters are detected:

  ...
  define_milter("milter-greylist") do |milter|
    milter.connection_spec = "unix:/run/milter-greylist/milter-greylist.sock"
    ...
    milter.enabled = true
    ...
  end
  ...
  define_milter("clamav-milter") do |milter|
    milter.connection_spec = "unix:/var/run/clamav-milter/clamav-milter.socket"
    ...
    milter.enabled = true
    ...
  end
  ...
  define_milter("spamass-milter") do |milter|
    milter.connection_spec = "unix:/run/spamass-milter/postfix/sock"
    ...
    milter.enabled = true
    ...
  end
  ...

You should confirm that milter's name, socket path and "enabled =
true". If the values are unexpected, you need to change
/etc/milter-manager/milter-manager.local.conf. See
((<Configuration|configuration.rd>)) for details of
milter-manager.local.conf.

But if we can, we want to use milter manager without editing
miter-manager.local.conf. If you report your environment to the milter
manager project, the milter manager project may improve detect method.

milter manager's configuration is finished.

Start to milter manager on startup:

  % sudo systemctl enable milter-manager

Start to milter manager:

  % sudo systemctl start milter-manager

milter-test-server is usuful to confirm milter manager was
ran:

  % sudo -u milter-manager milter-test-server -s unix:/var/run/milter-manager/milter-manager.sock

Here is a sample success output:

  status: accept
  elapsed-time: 0.128 seconds

If milter manager fails to run, the following message will
be shown:

  Failed to connect to unix:/var/run/milter-manager/milter-manager.sock

In this case, you can use log to solve the
problem. milter manager is verbosily if --verbose option is
specified. milter manager outputs logs to standard output if
milter manager isn't daemon process.

You can add the following configuration to
/etc/sysconfig/milter-manager to output verbose log to
standard output:

  OPTION_ARGS="--verbose --no-daemon"

Restart milter manager:

  % sudo systemctl restart milter-manager

Some logs are output if there is a problem. Running
milter manager can be exitted by Ctrl+c.

OPTION_ARGS configuration in /etc/sysconfig/milter-manager
should be commented out after the problem is solved to run
milter manager as daemon process. And you should restart
milter manager.

=== Configure Postfix

Enables Postfix:

  % sudo systemctl enable postfix
  % sudo systemctl start postfix

Configure Postfix for milters. Append following lines to
/etc/postfix/main.cf:
  milter_protocol = 6
  milter_default_action = accept
  milter_mail_macros = {auth_author} {auth_type} {auth_authen}

For details for each lines.

: milter_protocol = 6

   Use milter protocol version 6.

: milter_default_action = accept

   MTA receives mails when MTA cannot access milter. Although there
   are problems between MTA and milter, MTA can deliver mails to clients.
   But until you recover milter, perhaps MTA receives spam mails and
   virus mails.

   If you can recover the system quickly, you can specify 'tempfail'
   instead of 'accept'. Default value is 'tempfail'.

: milter_mail_macros = {auth_author} {auth_type} {auth_authen}

   MTA gives information related SMTP Auth to milters. milter-greylist
   etc. uses it.

Register milter manager to Postfix.  It's important that
spamass-milter, clamav-milter and milter-greylist aren't needed to be
registered because they are used via milter manager.

Append following lines to /etc/postfix/main.cf:

  smtpd_milters = unix:/var/run/milter-manager/milter-manager.sock

Reload Postfix's configuration.

  % sudo systemctl reload postfix

milter manager logs to syslog. If milter manager works well,
some logs can be shown in /var/log/maillog. You need to send
a test mail for confirming.

== Conclusion

There are many configurations to work milter and Postfix
together. They can be reduced by introducing milter manager.

Without milter manager, you need to specify sockets of
spamass-milter, clamav-milter and milter-greylist to
/etc/postfix/main.cf. With milter manager, you don't need to
specify sockets of them, just specify a socket of
milter manager. They are detected automatically. You don't
need to take care some small mistakes like typo.

milter manager also detects which '/sbin/chkconfig -add' is
done or not. If you disable a milter, you use the following
steps:

  % sudo systemctl stop milter-greylist
  % sudo systemctl disable milter-greylist

You need to reload milter manager after you disable a milter.

  % sudo systemctl reload milter-manager

milter manager detects a milter is disabled and doesn't use
it. You don't need to change /etc/postfix/main.cf.

You can reduce maintainance cost by introducing
milter manager if you use some milters on CentOS.

milter manager also provides tools to help
operation. Installing them is optional but you can reduce
operation cost too. If you also install them, you will go to
((<Install to CentOS
(optional)|install-options-to-centos.rd>)).
